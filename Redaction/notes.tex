\subsection*{I might have a rough idea\dots}

\textit{Following is a collection of ideas. This is probably to be taken not very seriously.}

Add something perhaps on how he can cramp into the model some paarameters so that only a
handful assets are being chosen (perhaps L1 reg. or something like that).  Also maybe we
could add another complexity where we would like to keep stocks we already have, perhaps
using a utility telling how much we want to discourage the new daily assets. That sort of
things.

Something else that was so far overlooked is the fact that the sum of all allocation
components need not sum up to 1. Again, a regularization with a plateau shape form could
perhaps translate what we need.

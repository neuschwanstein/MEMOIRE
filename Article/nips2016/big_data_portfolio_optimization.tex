\begin{abstract}
  Drawing on statistical learning theory, we propose a robust portfolio optimization
  mechanism agnostic to market distribution. In particular, our algorithm returns a linear
  investment policy based on the risk preferences of the investor, with guaranteed out of
  sample performance. We also provide guidance for big-data scenarios, ie. when the number
  of features is of the order of the size of the sample, thus enriching the learning
  theory literature. \comment{We conclude by contrasting small- and big-data scenario in a real
  application.}

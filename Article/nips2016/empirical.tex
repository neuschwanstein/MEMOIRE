\section{Empirical Results}

We now present empirical results driven by our model. We first show how the big-data
phenomenon arises for different regimes $p=O(n^k)$ and then we move on using comparative
analysis on a real dataset using alternatively only a $u$-loss regression with
regularization qon the returns, market statistics such as market volatility as measured on
the last $m$ days and previous average returns, and finally with a NLP reprensentation of
market financial news.


\subsection{Synthetic distributions}

Our experminental setup consists of a normal distribution $R\sim\normal(\mu=0,\sigma=10)$
in the return margin and of long tailed $t$-Distribution$(\nu=4)$.

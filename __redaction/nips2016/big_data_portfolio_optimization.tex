%  In recent years,  much pressure has been applied in order to allow portfolio management theory to address was required to evolve in order to  
  Drawing on statistical learning theory, we derive out-of-sample and suboptimal
  guarantees about the investment strategy obtained from a regularized portfolio
  optimization model which attempts to exploit side information about the financial market
  in order to reach an optimal risk-return tradeoff. This side information might include
  for instance recent stock returns, volatility indexes, financial news indicators,
  etc. In particular, we demonstrate that an investment policy that linearly combines this
  side information in a way that is optimal from the perspective of a random sample set is
  guaranteed to perform also relatively well (\ie, within an additive perturbation factor
  of $O(1/\sqrt{n})$) with respect to the unknown distribution that generated this sample
  set. Finally, we evaluate the sensitivity of these results in a high dimensional regime
  where the size of the side information vector is of an order that is comparable to the
  sample size.

  %   robust portfolio optimization mechanism agnostic to market distribution based on side
  %   information and on market returns. In particular, we exhibit a linear investment
  %   policy based on the risk preferences of an investor and on a sample of the market and
  %   show that out-of-sample and suboptimality guarantees on the quality of the certainty
  %   equivalent of the proposed investment can be provided. In addition, we also consider
  %   the high dimensional case where the number of these side informations is of the order
  %   of the sample size. }
